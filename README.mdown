mkrisher's dot-files
====================

My dot-files related to zsh, vim, etc....

I used to use Janus and Macvim. I'm going as basic Vim as possible. Keeping it simple.

a couple of files are referenced in zshrc
one is a logins file. I alias a lot of ssh logins, makes
it easier for me to remember, especially using ssh keys and 
unusual ports. For example, a staging server gets aliased like:
alias login_stage='ssh rails@staging.server.com'

a second source file is for projects. I alias a lot of file paths, 
it makes it easier for me to jump to the root of projects in the 
the terminal and start some of my other aliases like watchr or showlog.
